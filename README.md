# gator_grease
Common repository for all of my tampermonkey scripts specific to UF's websites. Enhancing UX script by script.

## Installation
### Installing required browser extensions
You need to have tampermonkey / greasemonkey or some other way to install userscripts in order to run this, so make sure you have your extensions ready before installing

* [Install Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
* [Install Greasemonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
 
### Installing the scripts
Navigate to the specific script you want to install. All of them (I think) come with a README in the header. If it interests you click the raw button and follow the prompts provided by tampermonkey or greasemonkey.

## Notes
I've only tested this on Google Chrome for Windows (Version 52.0.2743.82 m), but it should work on all major browsers that support userscripts.

## Contribute!
If you want to add some features to the scripts hosted, feel free to drop in a pull request. Bonus points if you have topic branches and legible code!
